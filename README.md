# HTML Basics: README

Welcome to the world of HTML! This guide will help you get started with the basics of HTML, the standard markup language used to create web pages. Whether you're new to coding or just HTML, this guide is for you.

## What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and structuring web pages and web applications. It consists of a series of elements used to enclose or wrap different parts of the content to make it appear or behave in a certain way.

## Key Concepts

### Elements and Tags

HTML is made up of elements, which are defined by tags. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The content goes between these tags.

### Attributes

HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about the element. Attributes are always included in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs.

### Nesting

HTML elements can contain other elements, creating a nested structure. Properly nesting elements is important for ensuring that your HTML is valid and works correctly.

### Doctype Declaration

At the beginning of every HTML document, you need to include a doctype declaration. This tells the browser what version of HTML the document is using.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document typically has the following structure:

- **Doctype**: Declares the document type and version.
- **HTML Element**: The root element that wraps all other elements.
- **Head Element**: Contains meta-information about the document, such as its title and links to stylesheets.
- **Body Element**: Contains the content of the document that is displayed to the user, such as text, images, and links.

## Common HTML Elements

### Headings

Headings are used to define the titles and subtitles on your webpage. They range from `<h1>` (most important) to `<h6>` (least important).

### Paragraphs

Paragraphs are defined with the `<p>` tag and are used to group sentences and sections of text.

### Links

Links are created using the `<a>` tag, which requires an `href` attribute to specify the destination URL.

### Images

Images are embedded using the `<img>` tag, which requires a `src` attribute to specify the image source URL.

### Lists

Lists can be ordered (numbered) or unordered (bulleted) and are created using `<ol>` and `<ul>` tags, respectively, with list items wrapped in `<li>` tags.

### Tables

Tables are used to display tabular data and are created using the `<table>` tag, with rows defined by `<tr>`, headers by `<th>`, and cells by `<td>`.

## Best Practices

- **Semantic HTML**: Use HTML elements according to their intended purpose to improve readability and accessibility.
- **Valid Code**: Always ensure your HTML code is valid by following the rules and guidelines of HTML syntax.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent style for indentation, casing, and naming conventions.
- **Accessibility**: Use attributes and elements that improve the accessibility of your web pages for users with disabilities.
