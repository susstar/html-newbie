## README: Getting Started with HTML

Welcome to the world of HTML! This guide will help you get started with the basics of HTML, the language used to create web pages.

### What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a webpage using a series of elements and tags.

### Prerequisites

No prior knowledge of HTML is required. All you need is a text editor (like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on macOS) and a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).

### Creating Your First HTML Page

1. **Open Your Text Editor**
   - Open Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (macOS). Ensure TextEdit is in plain text mode by selecting `Format > Make Plain Text`.

2. **Write Basic HTML Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML!</h1>
    <p>This is your first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

3. **Save Your File**
   - Save the file with a `.html` extension, for example, `index.html`.

4. **Open Your HTML File in a Browser**
   - Double-click the saved HTML file, or open it in your preferred web browser. You should see your webpage displayed.

### Basic HTML Elements

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document (e.g., title, links to stylesheets).
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the webpage.
- `<h1>`: Represents a top-level heading.
- `<p>`: Represents a paragraph.

### Adding More Content

1. **Headings and Paragraphs**

```html
<h2>This is a Subheading</h2>
<p>This is a paragraph under the subheading.</p>
```

2. **Links**

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
```

3. **Images**

```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description of Image">
```

4. **Lists**

- **Unordered List**

```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

- **Ordered List**

```html
